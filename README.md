RealSolarSystem Visual Enhancements for KSP

Welcome to RVE. This is my collection of modified textures, configs and other bits and peices that attempts to bring better visuals to NathanKells awesome RealSolarSystem mod using Rbray's visionary Overhaul series.
The mod is still heavily WIP, mainly because of the overhaul series being an experimental, unfinished but ongoing project of Rbray.

The primary aim of this project is to match the visual (and audio to come) aspects of KSP RSS as best I can to its real life couterparts, through the power of the overhaul series.


First and foremost Maximum kudos to NathanKell and Rbray who have contributed so greatly to KerbalSpaceProgram, (I see this mod largely as a mere extenuation of their awesomeness).
Credit also to the various modders of EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements prior to RVE cunjured up the various tricks and methods with EVE mod that I have benefitted so greatly from in RVE. - By KSP forum name: Proot, TheSonicGalaxy, all those who helped bring better textures to RSS and develop it in all ways, and to Squad for making such a beautifully open source game with such potential.
