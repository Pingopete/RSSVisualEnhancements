RealSolarSystem Visual Enhancements for KSP

Welcome to RVE. This is my collection of modified textures, configs and other bits and peices that attempts to bring better visuals to NathanKells awesome RealSolarSystem mod using Rbray's visionary Overhaul series.
The mod is still heavily WIP, mainly because of the overhaul series being an experimental, unfinished but ongoing project of Rbray.

The primary aim of this project is to match the visual (and audio to come) aspects of KSP RSS as best I can to its real life couterparts, through the power of the overhaul series.

ChangeLog:
V0.1 
- Initial Release, just Earth, many bugs, only some planet exteriors
- PQS cloud shadows removed until EVE Overhaul 9.3 (Terrain wrapped cloud shadows and realistic casting)

V0.2 
- All planet exteriors added
- Earth colours updated, based on apollo images
- RSS planet textures added/updated
- Earth PQS level stability tweaks
- Auroras added to Earth
- Changed Pluto texture
- Significantly lightened SS&PQS Land colour, balanced by reduced haze layers
- Introduced inverted fallOff power (Edge haze)

V0.2.1 - stable
- Updated to RSS 6.3 pre-release
- DL file archive fixed
- Fixed missing Uranus and pluto
- Removed all unnecessary files
- Rescaled textures correctly to prevent unintentional upscaling (thanks nathankell)
- Redundant Earth normal map temporarily removed
- Removed glitchy statosphere layer until EVE O9.3 is released with atmospheric shader
- Increased falloff rate of earth haze layers
- Fixed and updated missing Venus textures
- Fixed missing Pluto texture
- Added second haze layer to earth, brighter, sharper edge
- Rebalanced PQS/SS haze, still desperately waiting on Overhaul 9.3 atmosphere shader

V0.2.2 Dev/Testing
- Updated RSS config to 7.3
- Added blue haze to earths terminators
- Pushed horizon edge haze back in SS to better mimic haze in LEO (2D fake haze layers still look ugly, especially in PQS/ground level)
- Added experimental 'global land detail' texture to ScaledSpace, now looks much higher quality from LEO (Waiting on full biome based texture control)
- Added incomplete 8k Vagas city day&night textures (not yet tiled, very obvious at seems)
- Added new ocean texture and rebablanced ocean colour
- Added global ocean sun reflection in ScaledSpace
- Added brightness and shapness haze to the Moon to make it look more realistic from afar
- Rolled back to older terrain.dll at the cost of no bump maps to remove several obvious glitches
- Adjusted global ocean and land colour and contrast
- Added experimental PQS terrain shader texture
- Reduced ESun power of AFG nodes and altered multiply and radius 

- Mars not working
- Most planets untested other than earth and the moon
- Very unfinished city and land textures
- Still has ugly 2D layer horizon lines
- No bump map
- Probably many other bugs; this is simply where I'm at at the moment, just so you guys can play about with the new SS texture 


Maximum kudos to NathanKell and Rbray who have contributed so greatly to KerbalSpaceProgram, (I see this mod largely as a mere extenuation of their awesomeness).
Credit also to the various modders of EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements prior to RVE who cunjured up the various tricks and methods with EVE mod that I have benefitted so greatly from in RVE. - Proot, TheSonicGalaxy and to all those who helped bring better textures to RSS and develop it in all ways, and to Squad for making such a beautifully open source game with such potential.
